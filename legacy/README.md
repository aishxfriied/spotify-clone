# Legacy Static Prototype

This directory contains the original static HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype that was used to design and test the initial UI before converting to Next.js.

## Files

- `index.html` - Original static HTML structure
- `style.css` - Original CSS styles
- `utility.css` - Utility CSS classes
- `js/` - Original JavaScript functionality

## Note

These files are kept for reference and historical purposes. The current application is built with Next.js and can be found in the root directory.

The static prototype served as the foundation for the modern React/Next.js implementation, ensuring design consistency and functionality preservation during the migration.
